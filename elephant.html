                <p style="color:black;">At a shoulder height of around 11 feet and a length of 19-24 feet, the African elephant is the largest animal walking the Earth. There are around approximately 415,000 in the wild. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. There are two subspecies of African elephants: the Savanna (or bush) elephant and the Forest elephant.</p>

                <h2 style="color:pink; text-decoration: underline;" align="center">Why They're Endangered</h2>
                <p style="color:black;">African Elephant populations are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade. African elephant populations were severely reduced to its current levels because of hunting. In the 1980s, an estimated 100,000 elephants were killed each year and up to 80% of herds were lost in some regions. Additionally, African elephants have less room to roam than ever before as expanding human populations convert land for agriculture, settlements and developments. The elephants range shrank from three million square miles in 1979 to just over one million square miles in 2007.</p>
